The COVID bed slot booking system facilitates management and booking of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. Users can check availability, book slots, and manage bookings. It combines front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for UI and back-end (Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy) for server-side processing and database management. Components and Features: User Interface (HTML/CSS/JS):

Homepage: Displays basic information about the system, links to login or register. Login/Register: Allows users (patients, hospital staff) to authenticate or create new accounts. Dashboard: Upon login, provides access to different functionalities based on user roles (patient or hospital staff). Functionality:

Patient Functions:

View Bed Availability: Allows patients to see the availability of COVID beds in registered hospitals. Book Bed Slot: Enables patients to select a hospital, choose a bed slot (date and time), and confirm booking. View/Edit Booking: Patients can view their current bookings, modify or cancel them if necessary. Hospital Staff Functions:

Manage Bed Availability: Hospital staff can update the availability status of beds (occupied or vacant). View Bookings: Shows hospital's current bookings, with options to update status or details. Backend (Python with Flask):

Routing and Controllers: Defines routes for different pages (e.g., login, registration, dashboard) and handles HTTP requests/responses. Data Handling: Uses SQLAlchemy to interact with the database, managing user accounts, bed availability, and booking details. Authentication: Implements user authentication and authorization to control access to different features based on user roles. Database (SQLAlchemy):

Tables: Includes tables for users (patients and hospital staff), hospitals, bed availability, and bookings. Relations: Defines relationships between tables (e.g., hospital to beds, users to bookings) to maintain data integrity and enable efficient querying. Security:

User Authentication: Ensures secure login with password hashing and session management. Data Protection: Protects sensitive data (e.g., patient information, hospital details) through encryption and secure transmission (HTTPS).
